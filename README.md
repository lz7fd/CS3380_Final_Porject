# CS3380_Final_Porject
Final project of CS3280, database management system
Acutrally, because of CS2830 I had already done a lot of things on database management system, include the index page, login logout page,
the database management page; only thing I need to do is add some new functions like cross table management. In 2830, I creative an
Amazon ec2 server with mysql database, because Amazon ec2 is not free so I had stopped the server and move the system to infinity free.
Because this project can only finished by a group, but I don't want to get some other one disrupt my system, so I decide invite my friends
who studied CS1050 but no idea what is database, I teach them do some exercise management in this system, that is the meanning of it.
